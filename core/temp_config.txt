    README:
    The above lines contain base64-encoded strings separated with '@@@'. MACROSS
    is using looking for the first line following "9rk..." to begin looking for
    it's config values. (I do this to make sure I can put values anywhere inside
    any file as long as this unique string is present).

    The first three letters of each string are stripped by the function "startUp"
    located in the display.ps1 script (it is the first core script to run, since it
    has to know where everything is so it can build the main menu). Those three-letter
    strings are used as index keys in an array called $vf19_MPOD, and each base64 is
    the value for those keys.

    These have been stored here as a self-contained example of setting global default
    variables used by MACROSS and its tools, but I recommend you store these in a
    location outside of MACROSS that is only accessible by you or your SOC.

    I used this to keep from having to hardcode URLs, IPs, or other things into my
    scripts. (Not passwords or keys, please don't do that). This helps avoid keyword
    & regex scanners, curious outsiders, etc.
    
    For example, the very first index, 'log', contains the encoded location of where
    MACROSS writes its logs, while the last index in the list, 'ger', contains the
    encoded URL of a fictional EDR server. These can be retrieved by your custom scripts
    by using the "getThis" function (located in the validation.ps1 script), which writes
	decoded plaintext to $vf19_READ:

        getThis $vf19_MPOD['log']      ## This decodes the location of the MACROSS logs folder to $vf19_READ
        get-childitem $vf19_READ       ## This would list the contents of the MACROSS logs folder
        getThis $vf19_MPOD['ger']      ## This decodes the API you want to query on the EDR server
        $edr = $vf19_READ              ## Now your script knows where to access an API

    If you have a more secure place to store these types of common values, I recommend you
    write them all to a text file or json, and then modify the "startUp" function in
    display.ps1 to look at that file instead of this one in order to build the $vf19_MPOD
    array that all the scripts will use to find stuff.

    MAKE SURE TO KEEP THESE KEYS (even if you change their values; MACROSS uses these!):
    "log" = location where MACROSS writes its logs to
    "nre" = location of MACROSS master repository (currently your local MACROSS folder)
    "tbl" = location of the "resources" folder. You should change this value and keep your resources 
            folder in a controlled central location if possible, that way your users don't all need
            to download it with MACROSS.
